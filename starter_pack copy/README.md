# Starter Pack Copy Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains a copy of the starter pack notebooks and data files. It serves as a template or backup reference.

## Usage

- **Production scripts should use**: `starter_pack/` (main directory)
- **This copy directory**: Use only for reference or template purposes

## Status

This directory is maintained for reference but is not actively used by production workflows. All active development and data processing should use the main `starter_pack/` directory.
