Project Sentinel: Evolution Module

This module contains the Agent Speciation Engine - the heart of Project Sentinel's
ability to create evolving, specialized agent species for football analytics.

The evolution system enables agents to:
- Evolve and specialize through genetic algorithms
- Cross-breed to create hybrid capabilities
- Adapt to specific analytical domains
- Develop emergent behaviors beyond original programming
- Form symbiotic relationships within the ecosystem
