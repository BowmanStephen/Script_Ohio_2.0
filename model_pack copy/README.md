# Model Pack Copy Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains a copy of the model pack notebooks and model files. It serves as a template or backup reference.

## Usage

- **Production scripts should use**: `model_pack/` (main directory)
- **This copy directory**: Use only for reference or template purposes

## Status

This directory is maintained for reference but is not actively used by production workflows. All active development, model training, and predictions should use the main `model_pack/` directory.
