KNOWN LIMITATIONS - SCRIPT OHIO 2.0 SYSTEM
==========================================
Document Version: 2.0
Last Updated: November 10, 2025
Maintainer: Quality Assurance Agent

⚠️ CRITICAL UPDATE: Performance evaluation reveals significant system implementation gaps
preventing production deployment. See CRITICAL SYSTEM ISSUES section below.

DATA LAYER LIMITATIONS
=====================

1. Feature Distribution Anomalies
   - Issue: 10 of 10 key features outside historical 95th percentile ranges
   - Impact: May affect model training and prediction reliability
   - Mitigation: Monitor model performance and consider feature scaling
   - Examples:
     * Explosiveness metrics: 2025 range [0.882, 1.603] vs historical [1.084, 1.385]
     * Havoc rates: Lower than historical averages

2. Talent Rating Floor
   - Issue: Multiple teams assigned minimum 200.0 talent value
   - Impact: May not accurately reflect team strength disparities
   - Mitigation: Review talent assignment methodology for 2025 season
   - Affected Teams: Approximately 15% of teams show minimum values

3. Margin Calculation Convention
   - Issue: Margin uses absolute value rather than signed (home-away)
   - Impact: Affects modeling approaches requiring signed margins
   - Mitigation: Document convention and adjust modeling code accordingly
   - Status: Intentional design choice, not an error

MODEL LAYER LIMITATIONS
======================

1. Feature Compatibility Issues
   - Issue: Models trained on limited feature sets (8-13 vs 73 available)
   - Impact: Suboptimal model performance and underutilization of data
   - Mitigation: Retrain models with comprehensive feature selection
   - Affected Models: Ridge, XGBoost, FastAI

2. Performance Degradation
   - Issue: XGBoost accuracy of 43.1% below expected 55-60%
   - Impact: Poor predictive reliability for win probability
   - Mitigation: Complete model retraining with proper hyperparameter tuning
   - AUC: 0.416 (below random baseline of 0.5)

3. FastAI Model Incompatibility
   - Issue: Protocol version mismatch prevents model loading
   - Impact: Deep learning approach completely unavailable
   - Mitigation: Retrain FastAI model with current library versions
   - Error: "persistent IDs in protocol 0 must be ASCII strings"

4. Ridge Model Performance
   - Issue: MAE of 17.31 points above optimal range
   - Impact: Margin predictions less accurate than desired
   - Mitigation: Retrain with expanded feature set and regularization
   - Target: MAE ≤15 points

SYSTEM INTEGRATION LIMITATIONS
=============================

1. Library Version Dependencies
   - Issue: FastAI model requires older Python/library versions
   - Impact: Compatibility issues with current environment
   - Mitigation: Standardize on current library versions
   - Status: Isolated to FastAI model only

2. Computational Resource Constraints
   - Issue: Limited feature set in current models due to training constraints
   - Impact: Not leveraging full analytical capabilities
   - Mitigation: Optimize training pipeline for larger feature sets
   - Current: 73 features available, only 8-13 utilized

METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS
==========================

1. Sample Size Limitations
   - Issue: 2025 data limited to weeks 5-11 (469 games)
   - Impact: Smaller sample size for most recent season
   - Mitigation: Continue data collection as season progresses
   - Historical Context: Adequate when combined with 2016-2024 data

2. Temporal Validation
   - Issue: Limited ability to validate 2025 predictions
   - Impact: Performance assessment based on limited sample
   - Mitigation: Implement ongoing validation as season progresses
   - Current Validation: Cross-validation within 2025 data only

3. Conference Realignment Effects
   - Issue: 2025 season includes major conference changes
   - Impact: Historical patterns may not fully apply
   - Mitigation: Monitor model performance and adjust features
   - Examples: Teams in new conferences may have different performance patterns

OPERATIONAL LIMITATIONS
=======================

1. Automated Testing Coverage
   - Issue: Model performance testing not fully automated
   - Impact: Manual validation required for model updates
   - Mitigation: Develop automated testing pipeline
   - Current Status: 67% overall test coverage

2. Real-time Monitoring
   - Issue: No automated monitoring of model performance
   - Impact: Performance degradation may go unnoticed
   - Mitigation: Implement monitoring dashboard with alerts
   - Priority: Medium for production deployment

3. Documentation Maintenance
   - Issue: Feature engineering methodology not fully documented
   - Impact: Difficult to reproduce or debug calculations
   - Mitigation: Create comprehensive feature documentation
   - Status: Partially documented

RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES
==========================

High Priority:
1. Retrain all models with full feature set
2. Fix FastAI model compatibility
3. Implement performance monitoring
4. Document feature engineering methodology

Medium Priority:
1. Investigate 2025 feature distribution anomalies
2. Review talent rating assignments
3. Expand automated testing coverage
4. Develop real-time validation procedures

Low Priority:
1. Optimize computational efficiency
2. Enhance documentation detail
3. Develop additional model interpretability tools
4. Create backup model strategies

FUTURE IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES
================================
1. Enhanced feature engineering with advanced metrics
2. Ensemble modeling approaches combining multiple techniques
3. Real-time data integration and model updating
4. Advanced validation frameworks and stress testing

CRITICAL SYSTEM ISSUES - NOVEMBER 10, 2025
==========================================
⚠️ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT BLOCKERS - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

GRADE F - CODE QUALITY CRISIS
=============================
Issue: Syntax errors in production code prevent system execution

Critical Errors:
- File: agents/week12_mock_enhancement_agent.py:681
  Error: SyntaxError: invalid syntax (trailing markdown ````)
- File: agents/week12_model_validation_agent.py:1017
  Error: SyntaxError: invalid syntax (trailing markdown ````)
- File: agents/week12_matchup_analysis_agent.py:691
  Error: SyntaxError: invalid syntax (trailing markdown ````)
- File: agents/week12_prediction_generation_agent.py:939
  Error: SyntaxError: invalid syntax (trailing markdown ````)

Impact:
- Prevents system execution and testing
- Blocks production deployment
- Affects all week12 agent functionality
- Creates impression of poor code quality

Resolution:
- Remove trailing markdown ```` from all affected files
- Implement syntax validation in development workflow
- Add pre-commit hooks to prevent recurrence
- Estimated time: 2 hours

GRADE D+ - TESTING FRAMEWORK COLLAPSE
===================================
Issue: Automated testing infrastructure non-functional

Critical Failures:
- pytest execution fails with import errors
- Test files cannot import agent modules
- Manual testing only option (inefficient)

Error Example:
```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/test_agent_system.py
# ImportError: No module named 'context_manager'
```

Impact:
- Cannot validate system functionality

- Manual testing only (time-consuming)
- Quality assurance process broken

Resolution:
- Fix import path configuration in test files

Working: Context Manager → Role Detection → Request Processing
Missing: Agent Execution → Deep Analysis → Advanced Response Synthesis

Impact:
- Platform not delivering on intelligent agent promises
- User experience falls short of design specifications
- Production deployment would disappoint users
- Architecture potential unrealized

Resolution:
- Complete agent execution pipeline
- Implement advanced response synthesis
- Add end-to-end workflow automation
- Estimated time: 2-3 weeks

API Inconsistencies:
- Documented methods return different data types
- Error handling inconsistent across methods
- Some methods lack proper validation

Impact:
- Developer productivity reduced
