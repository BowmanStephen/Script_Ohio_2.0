# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with current state tracking and status reporting.

## Current State Management

This directory contains the living documentation of Script Ohio 2.0's current implementation status, active work items, and immediate priorities. This is the single source of truth for "what's happening right now" in the project.

### Key Files

- **`implementation_status.md`**: Master status tracker with progress metrics and phase completion
- **`active_plans.md`**: Currently active development plans and their current status
- **`next_priorities.md`**: Ranked list of immediate next steps and near-term priorities
- **`AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS_2025.md`**: **Agent system implementation status and achievements (92% complete)**

## Usage Patterns

### For Status Updates
1. **Always Start Here**: Check `implementation_status.md` for overall project health
2. **Check Active Work**: Review `active_plans.md` for what's currently being worked on
3. **Plan Next Steps**: Use `next_priorities.md` to determine what to work on next
4. **Agent System Status**: Review `AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS_2025.md` for intelligent agent system progress (92% complete, Phase 1 operational)

### For Progress Tracking
- Update implementation status after significant milestones
- Mark completed items in active plans and move to completed items section
- Re-prioritize next priorities based on current project needs

### For Team Coordination
- Use these files for daily standup preparation
- Reference in project update meetings
- Include in status reports to stakeholders

## Update Guidelines

### Frequency
- **Implementation Status**: Update after each major milestone or weekly minimum
- **Active Plans**: Update when plans change or items are completed
- **Next Priorities**: Review and reprioritize weekly or as project needs change

### Content Standards
- Include date of last update in each file
- Use clear, measurable progress indicators
- Mark items with clear status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed, Blocked)
- Include brief notes explaining any blockers or issues

### Progress Metrics
- Use percentage completion for major phases
- Track specific deliverables with clear completion criteria
- Include both quantitative metrics and qualitative status updates

## Integration with Project Management

This directory integrates with the broader project management system:

- **Decision Alignment**: Status reflects decisions from `DECISION_LOG/`
- **Roadmap Progress**: Progress measured against `ROADMAPS/` timelines
- **Quality Results**: Quality assurance results from `QUALITY_ASSURANCE/`
- **Strategic Goals**: Status aligned with `STRATEGIC_PLANNING/` objectives

## File Maintenance

### Implementation Status (`implementation_status.md`)
- Master tracker for all project phases
- Includes Gantt charts and progress visualizations
- Updated with major milestone completion
- Reviewed and updated weekly

### Active Plans (`active_plans.md`)
- Currently active development initiatives
- Each plan includes scope, timeline, and current status
- Items moved to completed when finished
- New items added when work begins

### Next Priorities (`next_priorities.md`)
- Ranked list of immediate next actions
- Includes priority level and estimated effort
- Updated as priorities change or items are completed
- Used for planning next development iterations

**Current State Philosophy**: This directory provides real-time visibility into project status while maintaining historical context. All status information should be current, accurate, and actionable for project planning and execution decisions.
