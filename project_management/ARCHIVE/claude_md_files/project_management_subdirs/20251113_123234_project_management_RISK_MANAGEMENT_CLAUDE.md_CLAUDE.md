### Current Implementation

**Active Resolution Plan**: `vs_code_issues_resolution_plan_2025.md`
- **Issue**: 200+ VS Code diagnostic errors across agent system
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect import paths and missing package structure
- **Approach**: 4-phase agent-driven resolution
- **Expected Outcome**: <20 remaining issues, fully functional agent system
