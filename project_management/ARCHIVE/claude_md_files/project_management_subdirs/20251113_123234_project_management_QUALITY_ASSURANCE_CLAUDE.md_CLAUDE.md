- **Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and business metrics
- **Robustness**: Testing with edge cases and unusual inputs

## Quality Metrics and Monitoring

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage**: Percentage of code covered by tests
- **Code Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity and maintainability index
- **Documentation Coverage**: Percentage of documented code elements
- **Defect Density**: Number of defects per line of code

### Performance Metrics
- **Response Time**: System response times for different operations
- **Throughput**: Number of operations processed per time unit
- **Resource Usage**: CPU, memory, and disk usage patterns
- **Error Rates**: Frequency and types of errors encountered

### Model Performance Metrics
- **Predictive Accuracy**: Model performance on validation datasets
- **Training Stability**: Consistency of model training results
- **Inference Speed**: Time required for model predictions
- **Model Drift**: Changes in model performance over time

## Quality Assurance Process

### Quality Gates
- **Code Review**: All code must pass peer review before integration
- **Automated Testing**: All tests must pass before deployment
- **Performance Validation**: System must meet performance benchmarks
- **Documentation Review**: Documentation must be complete and accurate

### Quality Reviews
- **Daily**: Automated test execution and quality metric monitoring
- **Weekly**: Manual testing and quality assessment reviews
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive quality audits and process reviews
- **Quarterly**: Quality strategy reviews and improvement planning

### Continuous Improvement
- **Quality Metrics Analysis**: Regular analysis of quality trends
- **Process Optimization**: Continuous improvement of QA processes
- **Tool Evaluation**: Assessment and upgrade of QA tools and technologies
- **Training**: Team training on quality best practices and tools

## Usage Patterns

### For Development Teams
1. **Quality Standards**: Follow documented quality standards in all development
2. **Testing Procedures**: Implement proper testing at all development stages
3. **Quality Gates**: Ensure all quality gates are passed before deployment
4. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive quality documentation

### For Quality Assurance Teams
1. **Test Execution**: Execute testing procedures according to documented protocols
2. **Quality Monitoring**: Monitor quality metrics and performance indicators
3. **Issue Reporting**: Document and track quality issues and resolutions
