PRODUCTION READINESS CERTIFICATE
================================
Document ID: PR-CERT-2025-1107-01
Issue Date: November 7, 2025
Project: Script Ohio 2.0 - 2025 Data Update
Certifying Authority: Quality Assurance Agent

CERTIFICATION STATUS: ⚠️ CONDITIONAL APPROVAL
============================================

This certificate confirms that the 2025 data update has completed quality assurance validation and is conditionally approved for production deployment with specified requirements.

APPROVED COMPONENTS
===================
✅ DATA LAYER - FULLY APPROVED
- Dataset integrity verified (4,989 records, 86 features)
- No missing values or duplicates
- Proper temporal sequencing maintained
- Feature engineering calculations validated
- Opponent adjustments correctly applied

✅ SYSTEM INTEGRATION - FULLY APPROVED
- All Jupyter notebooks compatible with new data
- Data pipeline end-to-end functionality confirmed
- File structure and organization maintained

CONDITIONAL APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS
=================================
❌ MODEL LAYER - REQUIRES COMPLETION BEFORE FULL PRODUCTION

Critical Items:
1. Model Retraining Required
   - Ridge model: Retrain with full 73-feature set
   - XGBoost model: Retrain to achieve ≥55% accuracy
   - FastAI model: Complete retraining with current framework

2. Performance Standards:
   - Ridge regression MAE ≤15 points
   - XGBoost accuracy ≥55%
   - XGBoost AUC ≥0.6
   - All models must use full feature set

3. Validation Requirements:
   - Cross-validation with minimum 5-fold
   - Performance benchmarking against 2025 outcomes
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Model calibration verification

DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
====================
Pre-Deployment Requirements:
[✅] Data integrity validation completed
[✅] System integration testing passed
[✅] Documentation generated and reviewed

RISK ASSESSMENT
===============
Low Risk Components:
- Data integrity and quality
- System compatibility
- Documentation completeness

Medium Risk Components:
- Feature distribution anomalies
- Model feature mismatch

High Risk Components:
- Poor model performance
- FastAI model incompatibility

CERTIFICATION AUTHORITY
