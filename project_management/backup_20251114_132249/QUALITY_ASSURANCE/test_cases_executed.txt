TEST EXECUTION SUMMARY
======================
Total Duration: 45 minutes
Environment: macOS with Python 3.13
Test Data: Full 2025 dataset (469 records)

FAILED TEST CASES ANALYSIS
==========================
TC-025: FastAI Model Loading
- Error: "persistent IDs in protocol 0 must be ASCII strings"
- Impact: FastAI model completely unusable
- Resolution: Requires complete retraining with current framework

TC-028: Model Feature Compatibility
- Error: Models trained on 8-13 features, data has 73 features
- Impact: Models cannot utilize full feature set
- Resolution: Retrain models with proper feature selection

TC-031: XGBoost AUC Performance
- Error: AUC of 0.416 below random baseline of 0.5
- Impact: Model performance worse than random
- Resolution: Complete model retraining required

TC-032: FastAI Performance Test
- Error: Dependent on TC-025 failure
- Impact: Cannot evaluate FastAI model performance
- Resolution: Fix TC-025 first

WARNING ANALYSIS
================
TC-029: Ridge Model MAE
- Warning: MAE of 17.31 points above optimal range
- Impact: Acceptable but could be improved
- Recommendation: Retrain with more features

TC-030: XGBoost Accuracy
- Warning: Accuracy of 43.1% below expected ~55-60%
- Impact: Poor predictive performance
- Recommendation: Complete model retraining
