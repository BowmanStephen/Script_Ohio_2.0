# Agent Specifications

This directory contains detailed specifications for each agent in the Multi-Agent Recovery Architecture.

## Agent Categories

### Foundation Infrastructure Agents
- `master_orchestrator_agent.md` - Central coordination and workflow management
- `sandbox_manager_agent.md` - Isolated repair environments and safety
- `system_diagnostics_agent.md` - Comprehensive system analysis and issue detection

### Domain-Specific Repair Agents
- `code_quality_agent.md` - Automated code standardization and PEP 8 compliance
- `dependency_resolution_agent.md` - Import and dependency management
- `agent_framework_repair_agent.md` - Agent system fixes and optimizations
- `model_system_repair_agent.md` - ML model integration and interface fixes
- `data_pipeline_repair_agent.md` - Data flow and processing repairs
- `async_optimization_agent.md` - Performance and concurrency optimization

### Quality Assurance Agents
- `performance_tuning_agent.md` - System-wide optimization and tuning
- `validation_agent.md` - Comprehensive testing and validation

## Document Structure

Each agent specification includes:
- **Purpose and Scope** - What the agent does and its boundaries
- **Capabilities** - Specific skills and functions
- **Target Issues** - What problems the agent is designed to solve
- **Sandbox Strategy** - How the agent operates in isolated environments
- **Interface Specifications** - API definitions and communication protocols
- **Performance Metrics** - Success criteria and measurement methods
- **Dependencies** - Required tools, libraries, and system access
- **Implementation Notes** - Technical considerations and best practices

## Usage

These specifications serve as:
1. **Implementation Guides** - Detailed instructions for building each agent
2. **Integration Documentation** - How agents work together
3. **Testing Frameworks** - Validation procedures for each agent
4. **Reference Material** - Technical specifications for maintenance
