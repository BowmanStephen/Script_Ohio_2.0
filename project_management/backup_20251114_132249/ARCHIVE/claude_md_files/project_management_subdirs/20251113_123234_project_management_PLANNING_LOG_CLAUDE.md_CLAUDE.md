# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with planning logs and iteration history.

## Planning Log Management

This directory maintains a chronological record of all planning activities, iterations, and planning process evolution. This serves as the historical record of how the project has evolved over time and provides insights into planning effectiveness.

### Purpose and Scope

The planning log captures:
- Planning session outcomes and decisions
- Iteration retrospectives and lessons learned
- Planning process improvements and methodology changes
- Historical context for current planning approaches

## Planning Documentation Standards

### Planning Session Records
For each planning session or iteration:
1. **Date and Duration**: When planning occurred and how long it took
2. **Participants**: Who was involved in planning
3. **Objectives**: What was planned to be accomplished
4. **Outcomes**: What was actually decided and planned
5. **Action Items**: Specific tasks and assignments resulting from planning
6. **Assumptions**: Key assumptions made during planning
7. **Risks Identified**: New risks or issues discovered
8. **Changes from Previous Plan**: How this differs from prior planning

### Iteration Records
For each development iteration:
1. **Iteration Period**: Start and end dates
2. **Goals**: Objectives for the iteration
3. **Planned Work**: What was intended to be completed
4. **Actual Results**: What was actually accomplished
5. **Variance Analysis**: Differences between planned and actual
6. **Lessons Learned**: What was learned during the iteration
7. **Process Improvements**: Changes to make for future iterations

## Usage Patterns

### For Planning Process Improvement
1. **Historical Analysis**: Review past planning sessions to identify patterns
2. **Effectiveness Assessment**: Evaluate planning accuracy and outcomes
3. **Process Evolution**: Track how planning approaches have changed over time

### For Project Context
1. **Decision History**: Understand how current plans evolved from previous planning
2. **Assumption Tracking**: Review historical assumptions and their validity
3. **Risk Evolution**: Track how risks have been identified and managed over time

### For Team Learning
1. **Lessons Learned**: Review what has worked and what hasn't in planning
2. **Planning Techniques**: Identify effective planning approaches
3. **Team Performance**: Track planning accuracy and estimation improvements

## File Organization

### Chronological Structure
- Organize files by time periods (weekly, monthly, quarterly)
- Use consistent naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD_planning_session.md`
- Maintain summary files for each time period

### Planning Categories
- **Sprint/Iteration Planning**: Short-term tactical planning
- **Release Planning**: Medium-term feature planning
- **Strategic Planning**: Long-term vision and goal planning
- **Retrospective Planning**: Process improvement planning

### Template Structure
Use consistent templates for planning documentation:
- Planning session template
- Iteration review template
- Retrospective template
- Process improvement template

## Integration with Project Management

This planning log integrates with the broader project management system:

- **Decision Log**: Planning decisions referenced in decision logs
- **Current State**: Planning outcomes reflected in current status
- **Roadmaps**: Planning aligned with strategic roadmaps
- **Quality Assurance**: Planning effectiveness measured by quality outcomes

## Planning Review Process

### Regular Reviews
- **Sprint Reviews**: Review iteration planning accuracy and outcomes
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Assess planning process effectiveness
- **Annual Reviews**: Comprehensive planning methodology evaluation

### Planning Metrics
Track planning effectiveness through:
- **Planning Accuracy**: Planned vs. actual outcomes
- **Estimation Quality**: Time and effort estimation accuracy
- **Goal Achievement**: Percentage of planned goals completed
- **Process Efficiency**: Time spent planning vs. results achieved

### Process Improvement
- Identify planning process bottlenecks and issues
- Experiment with new planning techniques and approaches
- Document lessons learned and best practices
- Continuously refine planning templates and processes

## Access Guidelines

### For Planning Participants
- Review previous planning sessions before new planning activities
- Update planning logs promptly after each planning session
- Include both successes and challenges in planning documentation

### For Process Improvement
- Analyze planning trends and patterns over time
- Identify effective planning practices and techniques
- Share planning lessons learned across the team

### For Historical Context
- Use planning logs to understand project evolution
- Reference past planning when making current decisions
- Maintain continuity in planning approaches and methodologies

## File Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Update planning logs within 24 hours of planning sessions
- Complete iteration records at the end of each iteration
- Review and summarize planning effectiveness monthly

### Archive Management
- Archive old planning files to maintain directory organization
- Create summary documents for historical periods
- Maintain index files for easy reference to historical planning

**Planning Log Philosophy**: This directory provides a comprehensive historical record of planning activities and their outcomes. By maintaining detailed planning logs, the project can learn from experience, improve planning processes, and maintain context for how current plans evolved from previous planning efforts.
