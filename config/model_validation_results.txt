MODEL VALIDATION RESULTS
========================
Test Date: 2025-11-07
Models Tested: Ridge Regression, XGBoost, FastAI

RIDGE REGRESSION MODEL (2025)
=============================
Status: ⚠️ LIMITED FUNCTIONALITY
File: ridge_model_2025.joblib
Size: 0.00 MB

✅ Model Loading: Successful
✅ Feature Compatibility: Works with 8 features
⚠️ Feature Mismatch: Trained on limited feature set
✅ Prediction Generation: 469 predictions generated
✅ Output Range: [-19.15, 14.87] (reasonable margins)

Performance Metrics:
- MAE: 17.31 points (baseline performance)
- Features Used: 8 of 73 available
- Training Data: Updated 2025 dataset

Issues:
- Model uses only 8 features when 73 are available
- Should be retrained with full feature set for improved performance
- No feature importance information available

XGBOOST MODEL (2025)
====================
Status: ⚠️ SUBOPTIMAL PERFORMANCE
File: xgb_home_win_model_2025.pkl
Size: 0.31 MB

✅ Model Loading: Successful
✅ Feature Compatibility: Works with 13 features
⚠️ Feature Mismatch: Trained on limited feature set
✅ Prediction Generation: 469 win probabilities generated
✅ Output Range: [0.128, 0.939] (proper probability range)

Performance Metrics:
- Accuracy: 43.1% (below expected ~55-60%)
- AUC: 0.416 (below random baseline of 0.5)
- Log Loss: 0.828
- Features Used: 13 of 73 available

Issues:
- Poor predictive performance suggests underfitting
- AUC below 0.5 indicates worse than random performance
- Model needs complete retraining with proper feature engineering

FASTAI MODEL
============
Status: ❌ INCOMPATIBLE
File: fastai_home_win_model.pkl
Size: 0.20 MB

❌ Model Loading: Failed
❌ Error: "persistent IDs in protocol 0 must be ASCII strings"
❌ Compatibility: Protocol version mismatch

Issues:
- Pickle protocol version incompatibility
- Model was created with older Python/library versions
- Requires complete retraining with current framework

ORIGINAL MODEL COMPATIBILITY
============================
Status: ❌ FEATURE MISMATCH

Ridge Original:
- Expected Features: 8
- Current Features: 73
- Compatibility: Feature name mismatch

XGBoost Original:
- Expected Features: 13
- Current Features: 73
- Compatibility: Feature name mismatch

MODEL PERFORMANCE COMPARISON
============================
Model | Features | MAE | Accuracy | AUC | Status
-------|----------|-----|----------|-----|--------
Ridge 2025 | 8 | 17.31 | - | - | Limited
XGBoost 2025 | 13 | - | 0.431 | 0.416 | Poor
FastAI | N/A | - | - | - | Incompatible

VALIDATION SUMMARY
==================
Overall Status: ❌ REQUIRES RETRAINING

Critical Issues:
1. All models trained on insufficient feature sets
2. XGBoost performance below acceptable thresholds
3. FastAI model completely incompatible
4. No model utilizes full 73-feature dataset

Recommendations:
1. Retrain all models with complete feature set
2. Implement proper cross-validation frameworks
3. Add feature selection and regularization
4. Update model training pipelines for current libraries
5. Establish performance benchmarks and monitoring

VERIFICATION STATUS: NOT APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION
