Keep your `CFBD_API_KEY` in the environment before running any cells. Steps covered:\n",

        "1. Configure shared paths and imports for the new `data_sources` and `features` modules.\n",
        "2. Instantiate REST (production + Next) clients with automatic rate limiting. GraphQL client is optional.\n",
        "3. Fetch sample games for a target season/week and preview the payloads.\n",
        "4. **Compare performance** between REST and GraphQL methods.\n",
        "5. Convert raw payloads into the 86-feature schema using `CFBDFeatureEngineer`.\n",
