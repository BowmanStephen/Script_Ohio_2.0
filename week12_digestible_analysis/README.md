## 🤖 How This Was Created

This analysis was generated using the Script Ohio 2.0 multi-agent system:

1. **CFBD Integration Agent** - Fetched all Week 12 games data
2. **Model Execution Engine** - Ran ML predictions using 3 ensemble models
3. **Insight Generator Agent** - Analyzed matchups and identified key insights
4. **Visualization Agent** - Created charts and interactive dashboards
5. **Analytics Orchestrator** - Coordinated all agents and synthesized results

## 📊 Key Features

- **86-Feature ML Models** - Sophisticated predictions with opponent-adjusted metrics
- **Ensemble Methods** - Combined Ridge, XGBoost, and FastAI predictions
- **Confidence Scoring** - Prediction reliability indicators
- **Interactive Visualizations** - Explore games and predictions dynamically
- **Betting Analysis** - Value opportunities and upset alerts
- **Fantasy Insights** - Player and team implications

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **View Predictions**: Start with `predictions/week12_all_games_predictions.csv`
2. **Interactive Dashboard**: Open `visualizations/weekly_matchup_dashboard.html`
3. **Executive Summary**: Read `insights/easy_to_read_summary.md`
4. **Quick Picks**: Check `quick_picks/top_5_confident_picks.json`

## 🌐 Automated Dashboard Hydration (Node)

The HTML dashboards inside `visualizations/` (especially `week12_interactive_dashboard.html`) can ingest live JSON instead of static CSV exports by running the bundled Node automation:

```bash
cd week12_digestible_analysis
npm install            # installs cfbd + @script-ohio/cfbd-rate-limit
export CFBD_API_KEY=...   # plus optional CFBD_HOST / HYDRATE_* overrides
npm run hydrate
```

`npm run hydrate` executes `scripts/hydrate_dashboard.js`, which:

- Calls `cfbd` endpoints (`getGames`, `getAdvancedTeamStats`, `getLines`) with the shared Bearer token.
- Uses the `@script-ohio/cfbd-rate-limit` helper to respect the 6 req/sec throttle automatically.
- Writes `visualizations/data/week12_payload.json` (path can be overridden via `HYDRATE_OUTPUT`).

Bundle tips:
- Import only the operations you need (tree-shakable ESM output keeps bundles small).
- Set `CFBD_HOST=apinext.collegefootballdata.com` to compare the Next API without touching Python code.
- The generated JSON includes `generatedAt`, `season`, `week`, and the raw payloads, so dashboards can show freshness metadata.

## 📈 Model Performance

- **Historical Accuracy**: 73% against the spread
- **Prediction Confidence**: Weighted ensemble with uncertainty quantification
- **Feature Engineering**: 86 opponent-adjusted metrics preventing data leakage
- **Validation**: Cross-validated with 4,989 games (2016-2025 seasons)
