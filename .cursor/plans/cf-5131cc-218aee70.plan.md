# Align CFBD Workflows Across Packs

## Goals

- Identify pain points between starter pack notebooks, model pack training pipeline, and agent system when consuming live CollegeFootballData data.
- Outline concrete documentation/code updates needed so all packs reference the same guidance on API clients, rate limiting, and data refresh workflows.
- Prioritize actions that unblock dashboard hydration (JS), model retraining (Python), and agent orchestration.

## Steps

1. **Catalog Current Workflows**

- Starter Pack: summarize notebook bootstrap (`_auto_setup.py`), live loader flag, data-refresh CLI.
- Model Pack: note training data refresh scripts, fixed models, auto-setup requirements.
- Agents: capture `CFBDDataProvider`, caching, orchestrator usage.

2. **Identify Gaps/Conflicts**

- Where Python provider differs from TypeScript SDK (auth, host toggling, rate limiting).
- Where dashboards need JS-friendly guidance (e.g., Week 12 assets) but docs live elsewhere.
- Any duplicated instructions between packs that could drift.

3. **Propose Fixes**

- Documentation updates (starter_pack README, model_pack info sheets, AGENTS.md) referencing the new cfbd npm usage from the Week 12 work.
- Shared helper recommendations (rate limiter, telemetry notes) so both languages stay in sync.
- Suggestions for future automation (pre-hydrate dashboards, share JSON outputs for agents).

## Deliverables

- Written plan describing the alignment steps across the three directories.
- Highlighted files to update with brief rationale (no code changes yet).
- Next actions that the user (or future tasks) can implement once the plan is approved.
