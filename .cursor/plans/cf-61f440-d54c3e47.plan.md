# CFBD Integration Overhaul Plan

## 1. API Client Foundations

- Review `requirements.txt` and add/upgrade `cfbd` plus GraphQL helpers (e.g., `gql`).
- Create shared utilities (`src/data_sources/cfbd_client.py`) implementing REST + Next host switching, auth via `CFBD_API_KEY`, rate limiting, and retry/backoff.
- Add a parallel GraphQL client module (`src/data_sources/cfbd_graphql.py`) that exposes typed query helpers for high-value entities (games, teams, recruits), including subscription scaffolding.

## 2. Data Ingestion & Transformation

- Build ingestion workflows under `starter_pack/notebooks` (new notebook `starter_pack/notebooks/CFBD_Ingestion.ipynb`) that demonstrate pulling REST, Next, and GraphQL data, persisting sanitized extracts to `outputs/` (gitignored), and documenting rate-limit best practices.
- Implement a transformation module (`src/features/cfbd_feature_engineering.py`) that maps ingested data into the 86-feature schema used by `model_pack/updated_training_data.csv`.
- Add CLI entry point (`scripts/cfbd_pull.py`) to trigger batch downloads + transformations with parameters (season, team, data source).

## 3. Agent System Enhancements

- Extend `agents/insight_generator_agent.py` to call the new CFBD utilities for live data pulls; add capabilities like `cfbd_real_time_analysis` and `graphql_trend_scan` with proper execution-time estimates.
- Update `agents/workflow_automator_agent.py` to chain ingestion → feature engineering → model inference pipelines using the new modules.
- Register any new capabilities in `agents/analytics_orchestrator.py`, ensuring permission checks align with READ_EXECUTE_WRITE requirements.

## 4. Notebooks & Documentation

- Add an exploratory GraphQL notebook (`starter_pack/notebooks/CFBD_GraphQL_Playground.ipynb`) showcasing sample queries, pagination, and subscriptions.
- Update `starter_pack/README.md` and `AGENTS.md` with instructions for configuring API keys, using the new utilities, and understanding agent capability changes.
- Include a troubleshooting section covering auth errors, rate limits, and GraphQL access tiers.

## 5. Testing & Validation

- Expand `tests/` with mocked REST/GraphQL responses to cover the client modules and agent integrations (e.g., `tests/test_cfbd_clients.py`, `tests/test_insight_generator_cfbd.py`).
- Add notebook validation checklist (run-all, data sanity assertions) to `project_management/QUALITY_ASSURANCE/VERIFICATION_REPORT_2025.md`.
- Run existing smoke tests plus new unit tests to confirm orchestration, then document results in commit summary.
